# First_Portfolio Example.

Hi. 
This is Khushal Mishra,
In the beginning i thought Web development will be very hard and complicated to learn.
So I gave my full concentration in learning Web development. And to challenge myself I tried making my first portfolio using HTML and CSS only, with defining each and every word.
This Was my first Web Development project "Basic Portfolio Webpage".
